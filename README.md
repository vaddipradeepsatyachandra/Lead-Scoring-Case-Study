# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study
Problem Statement:
X Education receives a large number of leads daily, but their current
lead conversion rate is only around 30%. The company needs to
improve the efficiency of their sales process by identifying and
targeting the most promising leads, also known as 'Hot Leads'. This
requires developing a predictive model to score each lead based on
their likelihood of conversion.

Business Goal:
The primary goal is to build a logistic regression model that assigns a
lead score between 0 and 100 to each lead, allowing X Education to
focus on leads with a higher probability of conversion. The target is to
increase the lead conversion rate to approximately 80% by prioritizing
high-potential leads and optimizing the sales teamâ€™s efforts.
